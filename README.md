# Using an NFL Roster for some Data Science Learning

My first little project to start my journey to learn Data Science with Spark and Python. This is using Spark 2 in local mode on my MAC. Also includes a bash_profile for how to run in Jupyter Notebooks using Python 3 which is run as an alternate env out of Anaconda.

NOTE: This does not use ANY best practices for running Spark SQL queries but just used as a tool to learn and become familiar.
